a video has two parts
video = container + codec

codecs
a codec is essentially a little program that is responsible for compressing and decompressing a video

types of codecs: h.264, theora, vp8  (these are different types of ways of compressing a video)

container: the way of packaging the video and audio

types of containers:  mov, mp4, avi, ogg, webm

The codec compresses the video.  The container will contain a particular codecs (video, subtitles, audio)

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
Uses Parallelism
The GPU can run at the same time the computation needed to generate a number of pixels.
For example, generate all the pixels on the screen at the same time as opposed to a cpu which will have to generate each pixel one after the others.  As the CPU can only do one thing at a time.

(Remember myth busters image drawing example).
